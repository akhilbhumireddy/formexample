- Use **CSS Flexbox** or **Grid** for layout.
- Include comments in your **JavaScript** or **React** code to explain key sections.

### Submission Instructions

#### Must Have

- Submit the project via a **GitHub repository** or share a **Codepen** link.
- The repository should include:
  - `index.html`
  - `styles.css`
  - `script.js` or `App.js` (for React)
  - **Optional**: Add screenshots of the final web page in the repository.
- Ensure the repository has a descriptive **README.md** file.

#### Nice to Have
